# theGarden
A game to relax in the quiet of your own garden. Plant stuff, let it grow and enjoy the scenery!

## MVP
At first, this game will just consist of a field and some kind of chest to place your produce in. You will get seeds by pulling them out of a menu from your controller. They will grow and then emit some particles when they're ready to be harvested.
